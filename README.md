# CCR-2015-12-22

From the Meetup invite: http://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/events/227470199/

Let's get together virtually and do another COMMUNITY CODE REVIEW. In our community code reviews, talk about the craftsmanship of Other Peoples' Code. This time, we'll talk about a popular (as in, >12 million downloads last month) npm module called request.js (https://github.com/request/request).

We'll get together on Google Hangouts (link to be sent beforehand), and the specific source file we'll focus on from the project is index.js.

If you want to review the file and add your comments before our community code review, please see the pull request where you can add your comments using the Github code review tooling: https://github.com/lasoftwarecraftsmanship/CCR-2015-12-22/pull/1/files

Have a Github account but can't see the file to review? No problem. Drop me a line at me@michaelrice.com so I can add you to our lasoftwarecraftsmanship Github organization or ping me on our Slack channel (see http://lasoftwarecraftsmanship.com for details on our Slack channel). 

Also, to help guide you in your code review, refer to our (under development) clean code checklist here: http://lasoftwarecraftsmanship.com/clean-code-checklist/ (and consider contributing to it too, please!).

BTW, listen-only mode on Google Hangouts is totally cool until you get comfortable!

FYI: to appeal to different developers with different interests in different languages and technologies, we'll do code reviews from popular open source projects from many different languages. Tonight just happens to be the language it is. Stay tuned for a language or technology you're more interested in later.

Finally, have a project, language, or something else you want to do a community code review on? Email me! me@michaelrice.com.
